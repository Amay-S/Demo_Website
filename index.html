      <p>
        I possess significant expertise in web development, with experience in Java, REST APIs in Java, using JDBC,
        Spring Boot, Java services, and Java servlets. My skills in frontend technologies like Angular and React,
        complemented by my knowledge of Adobe Experience Manager (AEM 6.1, 6.4, 6.5. MSM, CRX, JCR,
        Apache Sling), enable me to devise comprehensive web solutions. With an extensive grasp of both NoSQL and
        RDBMS, I effectively manage and analyze data, positioning me as a multifaceted asset in both development and
        data-driven decision-making.

      <h3>Software Developer -- Toronto, Canada.</h3>
      <p>
        I am a seasoned web developer with a strong passion for technology and
        problem-solving. With a deep understanding of both front-end and
        back-end technologies, I thrive in creating dynamic and robust web
        applications that drive business success.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical expertise spans a wide range of languages and frameworks.
        I'm well-versed in Java, JSP, jQuery, REST APIs, SOAP, Spring Boot,
        Python, Linux, SQL, MongoDB, AWS, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript,
        XML, JSON, Angular2, NodeJS, and Git.
      </p>

      <div id="more-content" style="display: none">

        <p>
          I've designed and implemented RESTful APIs with Spring REST, managed
          database connections using JDBC, and integrated AWS services
          including EC2, S3, and Lambda functions. To protect sensitive
          information, I've enforced security measures using Spring Security
          and OAuth2. I've also used JPA and Hibernate for efficient ORM
          mapping with SQL databases, and integrated CI/CD practices into the
          workflow, employing tools like Jenkins for streamlined development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a strong foundation in AEM, with experience in Sling Model
          and Sling Model Exporters implementations. I've developed Custom
          components, Templates, OSGI components, Servlets, and Workflows. My
          knowledge in AEM frontend implementations includes Sightly, Granite
          UI, Coral 3, and customization on Granite UI. My involvement in
          designing and implementing AEM modules has enabled web applications
          to incorporate features like WCM, Clientlibs, Digital Asset
          Management (DAM), Dispatcher, Workflows, SEO, and more.
