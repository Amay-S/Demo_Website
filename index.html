        <h3>Software Developer -- Toronto, Canada.</h3>
        <p>
          I am a seasoned web developer with a strong passion for technology and
          problem-solving. With a deep understanding of both front-end and
          back-end technologies, I thrive in creating dynamic and robust web
          applications that drive business success.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical expertise spans a wide range of languages and frameworks.
          I'm well-versed in Java, JSP, jQuery, REST APIs, SOAP, Spring Boot,
          Python, Linux, SQL, MongoDB, AWS, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript,
          XML, JSON, Angular2, NodeJS, and Git.
        </p>

        <div id="more-content" style="display: none">
          <p>
            I have a strong foundation in AEM, with experience in Sling Model
            and Sling Model Exporters implementations. I've developed Custom
            components, Templates, OSGI components, Servlets, and Workflows. My
            knowledge in AEM frontend implementations includes Sightly, Granite
            UI, Coral 3, and customization on Granite UI. My involvement in
            designing and implementing AEM modules has enabled web applications
            to incorporate features like WCM, Clientlibs, Digital Asset
            Management (DAM), Dispatcher, Workflows, SEO, and more.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've designed and implemented RESTful APIs with Spring REST, managed
            database connections using JDBC, and integrated AWS services
            including EC2, S3, and Lambda functions. To protect sensitive
            information, I've enforced security measures using Spring Security
            and OAuth2. I've also used JPA and Hibernate for efficient ORM
            mapping with SQL databases, and integrated CI/CD practices into the
            workflow, employing tools like Jenkins for streamlined development.
